PrettyText
==========


Yo, this plugin will take text and on-the-fly create images using rmagick and supplied fonts.

This plugin depends on rmagick, so make sure you're all gemmed up!

Then, throw any fonts you like into /path/to/your/app/fonts and bada bing.

In your views call something like this:

<%= pretty_text 'text you want rendered into an image', :font => 'Vera.ttf', :pointsize => '35px', :fill => '#CCCCCC' %>

you can also setup some psuedo constants to reuse styles sitewide.

In config/initializers/pretty_text.rb, you could have this, for example:

Sudara::PrettyText.presets[:h1] = {
  :pointsize => 36,
  :background_color => 'transparent',
  :fill => 'black',
  :format => 'PNG',
  :font => 'SebastianMediumPro.otf'
}

Allowing you to call:

<%= pretty_text 'fancy anti-aliased rendered text', :h1 %>

Generated Images are cached, so the hard work is done once.

A rake task is included to clear out the junk inside your trunk.

rake pretty_text:clear
